    <p>I believe fine art brings enjoyment of creation to the artist and the pleasure of interpretation to the viewer. Both emotions may be very different, but are equally gratifying and fuse to form a bond between creator and critic.</p>

    <p>Art is a powerful medium of expression. The boldness of color, the reflections of light, the calmness of water, or the brilliance of a sun set in a painting can all speak to oneâ€™s soul with no need for words. Art is a great communicator and an excellent teacher.</p>

    <p>The lessons I have learned from painting have enriched my life and continue to inspire me to share a colorful story.</p>
