Celebrate the life of your pets with a piece of art. Or, have a favorite scene on your property captured in an oil painting.

Send me a photograph with your preferences in dimensions. Based on the difficulty and detail required, I will give you a price quote and anticipated time of completion. A non-refundable down payment will be needed to begin the painting.

Upon the painting's completion, a digital copy will be provided to you free of charge. You will be under no legal or moral obligation to purchase the art at this point. If, for any reason, you decide not to purchase the painting, I will simply retain the rights.

Please contact me today and let's get the process started.
